🧬 AI-Based Healthcare Platform – User Flow
Step 1: Landing / Homepage

User visits the platform.

Presented with:

Quick intro / tagline

“Start your personalized health journey” CTA → triggers onboarding form.

Optional: preview of recent chats (from /chat_history) for returning users.

Step 2: Onboarding / Profile Setup

User fills in personal health form:

Basic stats: height, weight → calculate BMI

Lifestyle: gym/no gym, sleep patterns, daily activity

Diet: veg/non-veg/jain, likes/dislikes, allergies

Health conditions / diseases

Self-assessment: immunity rating / last illness

All inputs stored in Supabase user profile.

✅ Outcome: User now has a personalized profile that feeds every AI recommendation.

Step 3: Dual-Agent Chat Interface (/chat)

User can ask any health-related query:

Food suggestions, meal advice, immunity tips, exercise recommendations.

Agent Flow:

Analyzer Agent: fetches user profile + tracker data + chat history → summarizes context.

Coach Agent: reads Analyzer context → replies with personalized, actionable advice.

Chat remembers previous interactions → AI can reference past suggestions or trends.

Example:

User: “Can I eat pizza tonight?”
AI: “You had pizza earlier today, and your calorie intake is high — better skip it.”

Step 4: Image Query of Food

User can upload a food photo inside chat or dedicated module.

AI identifies the meal → returns:

Calories, nutrient breakdown, health impact, immunity effect

Personalized recommendation based on user profile (allergies, diet type, goals).

Step 5: Intake & Diet Management

User logs meals, hydration, and optionally workouts.

Diet Agent tracks:

Daily calorie intake

Nutrient balance

Water consumption

Recommends:

Recipes & meal suggestions

Supplements if required

All logs automatically update Tracker Dashboard.

Step 6: Tracker / Dashboard

Unified health hub showing:

Diet plans & intake history

Water & workout logs

Calendar view of daily totals (calories, hydration, activity)

Immunity Index (computed from BMI, diet, activity, last illness)

Gamification & streaks (hydration streaks, diet compliance badges)

Users can monitor progress trends visually.

Step 7: Chat History & Quick Access

On homepage or inside dashboard:

View past chats for reference

Click to reopen conversation in dual-agent chat interface

Helps AI retain memory and provide consistent advice over time.

Step 8: Continuous Engagement

AI proactively suggests:

Daily meals

Hydration reminders

Weekly immunity insights

Goal nudges based on streaks or missed targets

✅ Outcome: The platform feels alive, responsive, and hyper-personalized.

💡 Crux:

User onboarding → profile creation → dual-agent chat → image + diet logging → unified tracker → gamification → proactive insights.

Every feature is interconnected, feeding Supabase → AI → Tracker → User.
