- Analyzer Agent provides user context, Coach Agent provides responses.
- Image analysis integrates with Coach Agent for meal recommendations.

**Feature Hierarchy**:
- **Core**: Coach System (Dual-Agent Chat) + Diet management
- **Intermediate**: Image query + Genomic-informed recommendations
- **Supporting**: Tracker/Dashboard + Chat history + Pattern recognition

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Gamification + personalized immunity scoring = increases user engagement.
- Personalized recommendations based on extensive data collection and pattern recognition.

**Problem Statement Alignment**:
- System analyzes user's genomic (simulated), epigenomic (simulated), and lifestyle data.
- Offers personalized immunity enhancement strategies through nutritional recommendations.
- Implements real-time immunity-boosting recommendations via Coach Agent.
- Maintains privacy of sensitive data through secure Supabase implementation.
