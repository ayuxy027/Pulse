## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Transform development tasks into a structured, actionable roadmap by breaking major objectives into 10 granular subtasks that collectively ensure complete project completion.

## ðŸ§­ Strategic Approach

### 1. **Analyze the Core Requirement**
- Break down the main task into its fundamental components
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites
- Define clear success criteria for the overall objective

### 2. **Identify Relevant Files**
- Catalog all files that require modification
- Assess each file's role in the overall system
- Note potential impact of changes on other components

### 3. **Plan Implementation Sequence**
- Establish priority order for file modifications
- Consider interdependencies between files
- Schedule integration points for testing

### 4. **Draft Modification Strategy**
- Detail specific changes needed for each file
- Consider backward compatibility
- Plan for error handling and edge cases

### 5. **Prepare Development Environment**
- Ensure all necessary tools and dependencies are available
- Set up version control for tracking changes
- Establish backup procedures

### 6. **Execute File Modifications**
- Begin with the highest-priority files
- Apply changes methodically
- Test each modification incrementally

### 7. **Conduct Integration Testing**
- Verify all modified components work together
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Address any compatibility issues

### 8. **Document Changes**
- Update documentation to reflect modifications
- Create usage guides for new features
- Record lessons learned for future reference

### 9. **Validate Against Requirements**
- Compare final implementation to original objectives
- Ensure all features function as expected
- Verify performance and security requirements

### 10. **Final Quality Assurance**
- Perform comprehensive testing
- Optimize for performance
- Prepare for deployment or delivery

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
With this roadmap established, begin implementation by focusing on the most critical components first, ensuring each step builds toward the complete solution.
