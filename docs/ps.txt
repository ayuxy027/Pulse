Problem Statement:

Develop a system that analyzes a user's genomic, epigenomic, and lifestyle data to offer personalized immunity enhancement strategies, such as nutritional recommendations, exercise regimens, and environmental adjustments.

Functionalities:

Use epigenetic data (e.g., DNA methylation patterns) to predict immune system health.

Integrate AI to provide personalized, real-time immunity-boosting recommendations (e.g., supplements, lifestyle changes).

Design a wearable device that continuously monitors epigenetic markers and provides immediate feedback to users.

Include an AI model that predicts future health risks based on current immunity levels and personal data.

Implement blockchain to ensure privacy and security of sensitive genetic data.
